# RealizeOS — Post-Purchase Automation Setup

All automations run on self-hosted **n8n** at `https://n8n.realization.co.il`.
Importable workflow JSON files are in the [n8n-automations repo](https://github.com/SufZen/n8n-automations/tree/main/workflows/realizeos).

---

## 1. Google Drive Setup

### Upload files for direct download

1. Go to Google Drive
2. Upload the **Lite Edition** Obsidian vault ZIP
3. Upload the **Full Edition** package ZIP
4. For each file: right-click → **Share** → "Anyone with the link" (Viewer)
5. Copy each file's ID from its URL: `drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID_HERE/view`

### Update the download links

File IDs are already wired into both `docs/thank-you.html` and the `realizeos-welcome-flow.json` workflow in the [n8n-automations repo](https://github.com/SufZen/n8n-automations):

```javascript
const driveLinks = {
  lite: 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=14biPd0qhI2qTe4sOc1wtWTqkJawv9ti4',
  full: 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1TzFPlBZofwm5cWHOcZgdMvswpeha6IPE',
  setup: 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1TzFPlBZofwm5cWHOcZgdMvswpeha6IPE'

# If not yet running:
ssh root@37.27.182.247
cd /opt/n8n

```

### 4.2 Import workflows
In n8n admin (https://n8n.realization.co.il):

1. Go to **Workflows** → **Import from File**
2. Import these 3 workflow files from the [n8n-automations repo](https://github.com/SufZen/n8n-automations/tree/main/workflows/realizeos):

| Workflow | File | What it does |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Welcome Flow | `realizeos-welcome-flow.json` | Stripe webhook → parse tier → Google Sheets + Welcome email + Setup call email |
| Email Capture | `realizeos-email-capture.json` | Landing page form → Google Sheets + Lead email |
| Drip Emails | `realizeos-drip-emails.json` | Daily schedule → Day 3/7/14 emails based on purchase date |

### 4.3 Configure credentials in n8n
After importing, you need to set up these credentials:

1. **Google OAuth** (for Gmail + Google Sheets):
   - Go to n8n Settings → Credentials → Add Credential → Google OAuth2
   - Use the `info@realization.co.il` Google account
   - Scopes needed: Gmail send, Google Sheets read/write
   - Connect to all Gmail and Google Sheets nodes

2. **Google Sheets** — Single spreadsheet with 2 tabs (already created):
   - **Spreadsheet ID:** `1OrFpReqNSWPX-TZyMuWehLcUK7YimByz89lrfjDeuLw`
   - **Sheet1** (Leads) — Columns: `Name`, `Email`, `Challenge`, `Source`, `Timestamp`
   - **Customers** tab — Columns: `Date`, `Name`, `Email`, `Tier`, `Amount`, `Stripe ID`
   - Already wired into all 3 workflow JSON files

### 4.4 Update landing page webhook URL
After the Email Capture workflow is active, copy the n8n webhook URL and update `docs/js/main.js` line 185:
```javascript
// Old Make.com URL (replaced):
// const WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://hook.eu1.make.com/8x2o5l1elm1t2iwaavn7yyjxtwxhj715';
// Current n8n URL:
const WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://n8n.realization.co.il/webhook/lead-capture';
```

### 4.5 Activate all workflows
In n8n, toggle each workflow to **Active**.

## Note: Stepper Hash Routing (March 2026)

`guide.html`, `setup.html`, and `brand-worksheet.html` now use a **stepper wizard** (multi-step navigation). URLs use `#step-N` format instead of section anchor IDs.

**Legacy anchors still work** via alias mapping in `js/stepper.js` — e.g., `guide.html#lite` → step 4, `guide.html#troubleshooting` → step 9.

**Updated links in this repo:**
- `thank-you.html` now uses `#step-4` / `#step-5` / `#step-6` for guide links

**n8n email templates (external repo):** If any drip/welcome emails link to `guide.html#lite`, `guide.html#full`, etc., those still work via anchor aliases. Optionally update them to `#step-N` format when next editing the n8n workflows.
